# Strategy Pattern

## What is it?
The **Strategy Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

## Real-World Analogy
Think of **Navigation Apps** (Google Maps, Waze).
- You want to get from A to B.
- The app offers different **strategies**: Fastest Route, Shortest Route, Avoid Tolls.
- You can **switch strategies** at runtime without changing the navigation system itself.

## When to use it?
- When you have multiple ways to perform an operation and want to switch between them dynamically.
- When you want to avoid complex conditional statements (if/else chains).
- When algorithms should be independent of the clients that use them.

## Key Components
1. **Strategy Interface**: Declares the algorithm interface.
2. **Concrete Strategies**: Implement different variations of the algorithm.
3. **Context**: Maintains a reference to a Strategy object and delegates the algorithm execution.

## Code Example

```typescript
interface SortStrategy {
  sort(arr: number[]): number[];
}

class BubbleSort implements SortStrategy {
  sort(arr: number[]): number[] {
    // Bubble sort implementation
    return arr;
  }
}

class QuickSort implements SortStrategy {
  sort(arr: number[]): number[] {
    // Quick sort implementation
    return arr;
  }
}

class SortContext {
  private strategy: SortStrategy;

  setStrategy(strategy: SortStrategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

  executeSort(arr: number[]) {
    return this.strategy.sort(arr);
  }
}

// Usage
const context = new SortContext();
context.setStrategy(new QuickSort());
const sorted = context.executeSort([5, 2, 8, 1]);
```

## When to Avoid
- **Simple cases**: If you only have one or two algorithms, the pattern adds unnecessary complexity.
- **Performance-critical code**: The indirection can add slight overhead.

## Common Mistakes
- **Too many strategies**: Creating a strategy for every tiny variation leads to class explosion.
- **Forgetting the context**: Strategies should be stateless; state belongs in the context.
- **Not using composition**: Hardcoding strategy selection defeats the purpose.
