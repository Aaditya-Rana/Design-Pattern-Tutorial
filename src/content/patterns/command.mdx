# Command Pattern

## What is it?
The **Command Pattern** encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also supports undoable operations.

## Real-World Analogy
Think of a **Remote Control** or **Text Editor Undo/Redo**.
- Each button press is a command.
- Commands can be stored in history.
- You can undo/redo commands.

## When to use it?
- When you need undo/redo functionality.
- When you want to queue or log operations.
- When you need to parameterize objects with operations.

## Code Example

```typescript
interface Command {
  execute(): void;
  undo(): void;
}

class PasteCommand implements Command {
  execute() { /* paste text */ }
  undo() { /* remove pasted text */ }
}

class CommandHistory {
  private history: Command[] = [];
  
  execute(cmd: Command) {
    cmd.execute();
    this.history.push(cmd);
  }
  
  undo() {
    const cmd = this.history.pop();
    cmd?.undo();
  }
}
```

## When to Avoid
- **Simple operations**: If you don't need undo/redo, it's overkill.
- **Performance**: Storing command history can use memory.

## Common Mistakes
- **Not implementing undo properly**: Undo should truly reverse the operation.
- **Stateless commands**: Commands need to store enough state to undo.
