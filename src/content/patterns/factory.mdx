# Factory Method Pattern

## What is it?
The **Factory Method Pattern** defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

## Real-World Analogy
Think of a **UI Component Library**.
- You have a factory that creates Buttons, Cards, Modals.
- The factory decides which specific implementation to create based on the platform (Web, Mobile).

## When to use it?
- When a class can't anticipate the type of objects it needs to create.
- When you want to delegate instantiation to subclasses.
- When you want to provide a library of products.

## Code Example

```typescript
interface Button {
  render(): void;
}

class WebButton implements Button {
  render() { console.log('Web button'); }
}

class MobileButton implements Button {
  render() { console.log('Mobile button'); }
}

abstract class Dialog {
  abstract createButton(): Button;
  
  render() {
    const button = this.createButton();
    button.render();
  }
}

class WebDialog extends Dialog {
  createButton() { return new WebButton(); }
}
```

## When to Avoid
- **Simple object creation**: If you only have one type, just use `new`.

## Common Mistakes
- **Overuse**: Not every object creation needs a factory.
- **God factory**: One factory creating too many unrelated types.
