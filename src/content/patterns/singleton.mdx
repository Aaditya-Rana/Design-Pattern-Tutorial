# Singleton Pattern

## What is it?
The **Singleton Pattern** ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.

## Real-World Analogy
Think of a **Database Connection Pool** or **Application Configuration**.
- Only one instance should exist.
- Everyone accesses the same instance.

## When to use it?
- When exactly one instance of a class is needed.
- When you need global access to that instance.
- For managing shared resources (DB connections, caches).

## Code Example

```typescript
class Database {
  private static instance: Database;
  
  private constructor() {
    // Private constructor prevents direct instantiation
  }
  
  static getInstance(): Database {
    if (!Database.instance) {
      Database.instance = new Database();
    }
    return Database.instance;
  }
}

const db1 = Database.getInstance();
const db2 = Database.getInstance();
console.log(db1 === db2); // true
```

## When to Avoid
- **Testing**: Singletons make unit testing harder.
- **Global state**: Can lead to hidden dependencies.

## Common Mistakes
- **Thread safety**: In multi-threaded environments, need proper locking.
- **Overuse**: Not everything should be a singleton.
